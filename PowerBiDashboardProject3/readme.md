in this project, I have take insurance companies data and make different worksheet in power bi to analyse and see insight of data

An Insurance company wants to visualize the financial performance of
claims made against the policies. The data given contains the information
about claims processed in the month of January and February. The aim is to
plot visualisations which will provide a quick overview of claims data to the
leadership.

Dataset Information:
The data consists of 1000 individual claims. The most important variable of
interest is fraud_reported. This variable is labelled 1 if a certain claim is
reported to be fraudulent and 0 otherwise. Each claim in the data is described
by 40 different attributes, which are represented as columns. We can divide the
descriptive attributes into four main categories: the insured person, the policy
of that person, description of the incident and characteristics of the car which
is involved in the incident.
Perform the following tasks using Power BI with the aim to
visualize patterns which indicate Marks
